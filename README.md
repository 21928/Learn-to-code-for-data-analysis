# Learn to code for data analysis

This repository provides the Jupyter notebooks and datasets for the Open University course
_Learn to Code for Data Analysis_, which is available:

- twice a year on [FutureLearn](http://tiny.cc/lcda), with discussion forums and facilitator support;
- 24/7 on [OpenLearn](http://tiny.cc/lcda-ol), without forums and without support.

This repository does _not_ contain the course materials. It contains:

- one test notebook to check that your software installation includes Python 3 and 
the necessary data analysis and visualisation libraries;
- one exercise notebook, one project notebook, and the necessary datasets, for each of the 4 parts of the course;
- additional software for interactive pivot tables in part 4.

The course was written by Michel Wermelinger (parts 1 and 3),
Rob Griffiths (part 2) and Tony Hirst (part 4).
The course follows 
Merrill's [First Principles of Instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Principles_of_Instruction). 
More details on how are [here](http://tiny.cc/fpoi).

## The course
 
This hands-on course is an introduction to computer programming and data analysis. 
It teaches how to access open data and clean, analyse and visualise it. 
It adopts a reproducible research approach: 
the data analysis is written up and publicly shared with the code used in the analysis.
 
This course teaches how to write computer programs, one line of code at a time, 
to download, clean, analyse and visualise open data (using line charts, bar charts and scatterplots). 
The course also teaches how to write up and share data analyses in a reproducible way. 
 
Each part of this course is organised around a specific analysis project using open data from 
the World Health Organisation, the Weather Underground, the World Bank and the United Nations. 
 
All coding and data analysis is done with tools used by professional scientists: 
the Python programming language, the pandas data analysis library and 
the Jupyter Notebooks programming environment.
 
The course does not assume prior experience in programming, data analysis, or statistics, 
but it requires basic numeracy skills.
 
### Learning outcomes
- Understanding basic programming and data analysis concepts
- Awareness of open data sources as a public resource
- Using a programming environment to develop programs
- Writing simple programs to analyse large bodies of data and produce useful results
 
### Syllabus
- Python: variables, assignments, expressions, basic data types, if-statement, functions
- Programming: using Jupyter Notebooks, writing readable and documented code, testing code
- Data analysis: using pandas to read CSV and Excel files, to clean, filter, partition, aggregate and summarise data, and to produce simple charts
